          <p class="text-xl font-[600] text-White">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects
            I learned were current, if not more so,
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>

          <p class="text-[15px] font-[500] text-Light-grayish-blue-paragrapgh">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before
            I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

          <p class="text-[15px] font-[500] text-Light-grayish-blue-paragrapgh">‚Äú I started as a total newbie with
            virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
            for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</p>

          <p class="text-xl font-[600] text-White">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the
            bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
            learning from their experiences was easy.</p>

          <p class="text-[15px] font-[500] text-Light-grayish-blue-paragrapgh">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned
            about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
            gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
            an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>

      <p class="text-xl font-[600] text-Very-dark-blackish-blue">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
      </p>

      <p class="text-[15px] font-[500] text-Very-dark-blackish-blue-paragraph">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never
        written a line of code. I needed some structure from
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
        could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
        100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
